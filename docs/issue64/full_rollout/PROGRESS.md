Batch 12 audit重点:
- `ellen_joe_(cosplay)`〜`fisting` の1,000件を連続監査し、substring一致より対象identity・実用発見経路を優先
- `eye / face / finger / fire / fish / fan / fat / father` 系は語幹だけで一括分類せず、身体・衣装・行為・小物・生物・背景・画面表現へ個別に分離
- `firefighter / fire_truck / fire_escape`、`fishnet / fishing / fish_(food)`、`finger_gun / finger_tattoo` などの部分一致誤分類候補を再監査して修正
- 固有作品名・イベント・ミーム・語義不明の71件は名称だけで無理に確定せずUNRESOLVED
- external evidence はこの1,000件では未使用
- canonical/Japanese overlay/Special/#66 UI/searchは変更しないcandidate-buildのみ

## Rules

- accepted 17 top-level genres
- max path depth 2
- no visible catch-all
- beginner practical discovery path takes precedence over substring matching
- object identity takes precedence over modifier fragments
- keep pilot-v2 boundaries for role/clothing, sky/light, screen/composition, body/exposure
- ambiguous proper names/events/projects remain UNRESOLVED when evidence is insufficient
- canonical/Japanese overlay/Special data are not mutated during candidate build

## Persistence

Detailed row-level results are persisted directly in this GitHub work branch.

- branch: `chatgpt/issue64-full-rollout`
- manifest: `docs/issue64/full_rollout/MANIFEST.json`
- immutable detailed ledgers: `docs/issue64/full_rollout/batches/`
- normal batches may use `.csv.xz`; connector-limited batches may use ordered `.xz.b64.partNNN` text fragments with exact reconstruction hashes in MANIFEST
- batch 5+ summary JSON: `docs/issue64/full_rollout/batches/batchNNN_summary.json`
- past checkpointed batch files are not overwritten; corrections are recorded as later review/correction artifacts
- PROGRESS.md records the current sequential stop point
- Issue #64 records major checkpoints and review gates
- main is not updated until the full 30,629 candidate and audit are accepted

Recovery order for a new chat:
